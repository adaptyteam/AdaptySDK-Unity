# Observer vs Full Mode
*Compare Observer and Full mode and choose the right one for your case*

There are two ways to integrate Adapty SDK: Observer mode and Full mode.

## Observer mode

Observer mode gives you full analytics capabilities:

- Integrations including attribution systems;
- Advanced Analytics;
- Profiles CRM.

Integrating it usually takes under an hour, you'll only need to implement a couple of SDK methods. You can use Observer mode along with existing purchases infrastructure.

## Full mode

Full mode adds multiple features on top of Observer:

- Complete purchases infrastructure: managing access to the app including lifetime, handling renewals, billing retries, subscription offers, grace periods, etc.;
- A/B testing;
- Promo Campaigns.


Integration takes several hours, and in most cases, you should use Full mode as a complete solution for your app purchase infrastructure.
